	<h2>I’m a geographer with specialist interests and experience in GIScience and the analysis, management and visualisation of spatial data.</h2>
	<p>Based in Worcestershire, UK, I’m particularly interested in open source software such as QGIS, PostGIS and RStudio. I have recently completed a MSc in GIS and I enjoy running, hiking, travelling, literature, football and many genres of music (mostly whilst running, hiking, and sitting at computers...).
