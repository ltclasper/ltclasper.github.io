	<h2>I’m a geographer with specialist interests and experience in the field of GIScience and the analysis, management and visualisation of geospatial data.</h2>
	<p>Based in Worcestershire and occasionally Paris, I’m particularly interested in urban morphology, vernacular geography, volunteered geographic information (VGI), qualitative GIS and ambient geographic information (AGI). I’m an advocate of open standards and open source software such as QGIS, PostGIS and RStudio. I have recently completed a MSc in Geographic Information Technologies and I enjoy running, hiking, travelling, literature, football (non-league to champions league) and listening to many genres of music (mostly whilst running, hiking, and sitting at computers). I’ve also just started to make my first forays into the worlds of rowing and competitive darts...</p>
