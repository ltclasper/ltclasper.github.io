During the UK COVID-19 caused lockdown we have seen a massive trend towards online quizzes where social-distancing friends and family get together (virtually) using video conferencing and video calling apps to test each otherâ€™s knowledge. I made the following fun geography quiz for one of these virtual gatherings using QGIS and open geo-data, please feel free to re-use!
