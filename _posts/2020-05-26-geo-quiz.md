During the UK COVID-19 caused lockdown we have seen a massive trend towards online quizzes where social-distancing friends and family get together (virtually) using video conferencing and video calling apps to test each other’s knowledge. I made the following fun geography quiz for one of these virtual gatherings using QGIS and open geo-data, please feel free to re-use! It is a little UK-centric to cater for a predominantly UK audience, but I’ve also included a French language version. Answers are on the next GeoBlog entry.
