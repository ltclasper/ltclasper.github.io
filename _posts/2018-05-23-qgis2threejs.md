I've been playing with the excellent Qgis2threejs plugin for QGIS. It looks like it's had an overhaul for QGIS 3 and it really is a brilliant way to visualise any 3D geospatial data. The plugin allows you to setup a view with your layers in QGIS desktop and then export to a browser where your 3D model is rendered and youâ€™re able to pan and tilt the model.  

My example is [available here](/qgis2threejs/index.html), the link will open in a new webpage and will allow you to zoom in and out and have a good look at the model. It's a section of Birmingham (UK) city centre with an Ordnance Survey aerial image, digital terrain model base and the buildings extruded by using the MasterMap building height attribute.
