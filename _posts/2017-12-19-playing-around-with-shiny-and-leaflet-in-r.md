I've published my first Shiny web app based on some Twitter research. The study uses text from [Tweets to learn more about the vernacular geography of London's neighbourhoods](https://ltclasper.shinyapps.io/ldntweets/) by looking at which neighbourhood people think they are Tweeting from. It's a work in progress but it's quite easy to upload data from shapefiles, add some base mapping and start styling (although colour palette needs some work!). There are a few thousand Tweets in the point dataset so it is quite slow at the moment too. The next step is to add some more functionality like graphs and overlays and also some user interaction would be nice.
