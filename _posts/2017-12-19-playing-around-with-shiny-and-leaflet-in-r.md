I've published my first Shiny web app based on some Twitter research: <https://ltclasper.shinyapps.io/ldntweets/>. It's a work in progress but it's quite easy to upload data from shapefiles and start styling (although colour palette needs some work). The next step is to add some more functionality like graphs and overlays and also some user interaction.
