Adding a basemap into QGIS is essential to give you some context when doing spatial analysis or for using as a backdrop in map production. [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/54.910/-3.432) is an excellent choice for base mapping It is built and maintained by a community of mappers, is open and has worldwide coverage. One of the things I like about OpenStreetMap is the fact that is driven by local community knowledge, so you find colloquial names for geographic features that might not exist on mapping from national mapping agencies or commercial mapping services. It is not-for-profit so has no commercial interests, is produced by enthusiasm mappers (like me!), anyone can take part and it is also vital for humanitarian aid, often in places with little other available mapping.
