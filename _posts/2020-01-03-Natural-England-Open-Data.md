[Natural England](https://naturalengland-defra.opendata.arcgis.com/), the governmentâ€™s advisor for the natural environment in England have an excellent geoportal for viewing and downloading special data. There are numerous open access spatial datasets concerning, nature reserves, national parks, natural habitats, ancient woodlands, and areas of scientific and conservation interest. I have included a map I made below, in QGIS, which shows the impact risk zones around a SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) which is current in danger of having a housing estate built nearby.
