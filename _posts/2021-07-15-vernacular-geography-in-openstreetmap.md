I thought it would be interesting to see some examples of how local knowledge and vernacular geography is included in the [OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/About_OpenStreetMap) project.  The following examples are not seen in any other current mapping (Google, Ordnance Survey etc.) and are included because the volunteers who update the OpenStreetMap are residents or are familiar with the area. I chose to look at an area near to my home in Worcestershire.
